# Project Planning
The planning of the project can be separated in three parts: the research phase, the development phase and the presentation phase. During the research phase, the research questions described in this document will be analyzed. In the development phase, Scrum will be used as software development framework. This means that the software will be developed iteratively in sprints of one week and thus ensures weekly updates. The sprints will start on Monday and end on Friday. There will also be two moments where the quality of the code produced is checked by the Software Improvement Group (SIG). The development phase will end with the handing in of the final report.

In conclusion, the last phase of the project will be the presentation phase. A final presentation will be prepared, during which the final product will be presented to the TU Coach and the client, FeedbackFruits.
