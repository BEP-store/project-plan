# Project Planning
The planning of the project can be seperated in four parts: the project planning, the research phase, the development phase and the preperation phase for the presentation.  
During the project planning, the first two days of the project, the following will be defined: the description and goal of the project, the planning for the project and the research questions for the research phase.  

Scrum will be used as software development framework during the development phase. This means that the software will be developed iteratively in sprints of one week. The sprints will start on monday and end on friday.  
During the development phase, there will be two moments where the quality of the code produced is checked by SIG.  
The development phase will end with handing in the Final Report.

The last phase of the project will be the preperation for the final presentation. During this final presentation, the final product will be presented to the TU Coach and the client.
