# Problem description
Existing tools offered by platforms (such as GitHub) focus on collaboration and distributed software development. These tools however are created around the needs of developers, rather than to facilitate the software development process in general. This excludes a large part of the community from participating actively in the process. 

The tools developed at Feebackfruits are focussed on the improvement of education. Many of these individuals are non-programmers and thus are excluded from the traditional development process. The aim of Feedbackfruits is to create a platform where these individuals, who are often eager to improve the educational system, can be included in this process. This platform should be connected to existing Feedbackfruits ecosystem via an API.

The software development process has developed over time to 
- Steeds meer community engagement
- Feedbackfruits platform want extension
- Much knowledge and ideas present with target audience
- No capacity to implement all ideas
- Programming knowledge of the crowd combined with educational expertise == Good stuff!
