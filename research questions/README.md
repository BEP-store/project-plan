# Research questions
To make our understanding of what the software should look like more clear we have come up with a main research question and several sub-questions. See ... for an introduction to the general introduction to micro-services and the analogy to guilds, party members and roles.

How to structure community driven software development?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of existing communities?
- What are the common factors between software development and community engagement? (eg. open issue tracker)
- How can community resources be used to improve the software development process?


## Second-level questions

- How to get the right people at the right project?

- How can the development process be properly split?
-- Which key phases can be identified in the development process?
-- What is 
- How can be verified that the written software adheres to the requirements



- How to ensure that the right micro-services are developed?
- What should be the minimum requirements for such a micro-service?
- How to map an idea to requirements (automatically, community)?
- How to maintain progress during the process and make sure development finishes in a set time?
- In what ways can you involve the community to built a micro-service?
- How to manage the cooperation between different 'party'-members?
- How to built a clear and representative reputation-system?
- How to create an easy development platform for the feedbackfruitsplatform? (requirements testing)

Process
- What limitations does the existing software impose on our system?
- What existing software is there available already and what problems do and don't they solve?

These questions can essentially be split into two different categories: requirement handling and community interaction.
