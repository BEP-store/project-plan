# Research questions
To make our understanding of what the software should look like more clear we have come up with a main research question and several sub-questions:

How to structure community driven software development?
- How can be ensured that the right micro-services are built?
- What should be the minimum requirements for such a micro-service?
- How to map the idea to requirements (automatically, community)?
- How can the development process be split properly?
- How to maintain progress during the process and make sure development finishes in a set time?
- In what ways can you involve the community to built a micro-service?
- How to manage the cooperation between different 'party'-members?
- How to built a clear and representative reputation-system?
- How to create an easy development platform for the feedbackfruitsplatform? (requirements testing)
