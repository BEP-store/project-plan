# Research questions
To make our understanding of what the software should look like more clear we have come up with a main research question and several sub-questions. See ... for an introduction to the general introduction to micro-services and the analogy to guilds, party members and roles.

How to structure community driven software development?
- What can we learn from existing (non-software) communities?
- What are the common factors between software development and community engagement?
- How can community resources be used to improve the software development process?


## Second-level questions

### What can we learn from existing (non-software) communities?
- How do these communities work?
- What are the strengths of these communities?
- What are the weaknesses of these communities?
- What are the requirements for a succesful community-centered ecosystem?
- What are factors that can be utilized for software development?

### What are the common factors between software development and community engagement?
- What techniques are currently used to involve a community with software development? (eg. open issue tracker)
- What other techniques can we think of?

### How can community resources be used to improve the software development process?
- Which key phases can be identified in the development process?
- Is it possible to mix these phases and let every expertise collaborate at each phase?
- How can be verified that the written software adheres to the requirements (which requirements??)
- How to maintain progress during the process and make sure development finishes in a set time?


### Others
- How to ensure that the right micro-services are developed?
- What should be the minimum requirements for such a micro-service?
- How to map an idea to requirements (automatically, community)?
- What kind of reputation-systems are there and how do they work/ perform?

- In what ways can you involve the community to built a micro-service?
- How to manage the cooperation between different 'party'-members?
- How to built a clear and representative reputation-system?
- How to create an easy development platform for the feedbackfruitsplatform? (requirements testing)

Process
- What limitations does the existing software impose on our system?

### Duplicates?
- What existing software is there available already and what problems do and don't they solve?
- How to get the right people at the right project?
- How can the development process be properly split?

These questions can essentially be split into two different categories: requirement handling and community interaction.
